# Objects

Objects are **layout-only** primitives: reusable, context-free, and structural.

Included objects:
- `o-wrapper`
- `o-grid`
- `o-grid__item`

Example:

```html
<div class="o-grid">
  <div class="o-grid__item u-1/2@md-up">…</div>
  <div class="o-grid__item u-1/2@md-up">…</div>
</div>
```

Rules:
- no colours
- no typography
- no theme assumptions
