Cryst4l is a **foundation framework**, not a design system.

It gives you:
- a predictable cascade
- layout primitives
- neutral structural components
- a utility layer for explicit overrides
- tokens for theming and scaling

It does **not** give you:
- pre-styled components
- a “framework look”
- a theme engine

If you want quick visual polish, add a design system on top.
If you want CSS that stays sane for years, start here.
